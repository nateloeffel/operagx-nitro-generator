Takes advantage of Discord and OperaGX's free Nitro collaboration to quickly generate the desired amount of free 1-month Nitro subscription links.

To run:
```pip install requests json```
```cd "path/to/folder"```
```python main.py```

Links will be output to 'links.txt'.

# Changing Output Count
DESIRED_LINKS_NUM constant in main.py can be changed to desired number of links.

# Setting Proxies
PROXIES constant in main.py can be changed/appended to as needed to avoid rate limiting.
